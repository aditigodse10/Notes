## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Markup for the notes UI
- **CSS3** – Clean, modern, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Handles all note actions (add, edit, delete, persist)

## ✨ Features

- ✏️ Edit existing notes with one click
- 🗑️ Delete notes you no longer need
- 💾 Auto-save notes in **localStorage** (persistent even after page reloads)
- 🎨 User-friendly layout with color-coded UI and responsive design

## 🔍 How It Works

- Click the **“+ Add note”** button to create a new note.
- Each note includes:
  - A toolbar to **edit** or **delete**
  - A text area to type your content
- Notes are automatically saved to the browser’s local storage.
- Refreshing the page will not lose your data.
